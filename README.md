# Readminds Feature Study
Readminds [1] is a software with the capability of remote emotion detection, applied on players in eletronic games. Features like heart rate and facial actions are currently used to estimate a user's emotional state. Whereas these features provide satisfactory results for the method, new ones may furnish a reasonable increase on the overall performance. Therefore, this study comes with two primary objectives:
1. Engineer new features aimed at the emotion detection context;
2. Study the viability of the newly built features in the data used in [1].
